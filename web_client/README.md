# FestApp Web Client

A web-based interface for the FestApp ecosystem, built with vanilla JavaScript
and HTML/CSS. This project mirrors the business logic and some UI patterns of
the main Flutter application but is designed for lightweight, browser-based
access (e.g., ticket purchasing, registration forms).

## Overview

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that acts as a web client for:

- Users to register or buy tickets.
- Filling out forms with validation.
- Browsing "occasions" or events.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Form building**: Renders forms based on JSON configurations
  (`blueprint`).
- **EShop Integration**: Manages orders and tickets (similar to the Flutter
  app's Eshop component).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout using custom CSS variables and
  utility classes.
- **Component-based Architecture**: UI logic is split into functional components
  (see `src/components`).

## Architecture

- **Vanilla JS**: No heavy frontend framework (React/Vue/Angular). Uses direct
  DOM manipulation and custom component classes.
- **CSS Variables**: Extensive use of CSS variables for theming (light/dark
  mode).
- **Service Layer**: `src/services` handles API communication.

## Setup & Running

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
