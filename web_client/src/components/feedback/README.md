# Feedback Component

**Purpose**: Provides a floating action button (FAB) and a dialog for users to
submit feedback or report issues.

## Core Files

- `feedback_fab.js`: The floating button that triggers the feedback flow.
- `feedback_dialog.js`: The modal dialog containing the feedback form.
- `feedback_strings.js`: Localization strings.

## Usage

This component is typically instantiated at the root level or in a main layout
so it persists across different views, allowing users to report issues from
anywhere in the app.
