# Image delivery cutover evidence

Date: 2026-08-23
Status: P0 complete; P1 live; P2 infrastructure live and locally validated,
client adoption blocked on canonical release source

## Official product facts revalidated

- R2 buckets are private by default. Connecting a custom domain makes a public
  URL and enables Cloudflare Cache/WAF; `r2.dev` is not a production/cache path.
  Smart Tiered Cache reduces direct R2 fetches after lower-tier misses.
  Sources: <https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/buckets/public-buckets/> and
  <https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/interaction-cloudflare-products/r2/>.
- Worker cache hits still count as Worker requests (though they avoid CPU), so a
  Worker Cache API path cannot meet the no-per-view-Worker outcome.
  Source: <https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/>.
- Images Free includes 5,000 unique transformations/month, rejects new variants
  with error 9422 after that threshold and does not bill the excess. Images Paid
  includes the first 5,000 and charges $0.50/1,000 additional transformations.
  `onerror=redirect` can serve a same-domain original on the Free limit.
  Source: <https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/pricing/>.
- Source restrictions distinguish exact subdomains; adding a root does not
  implicitly allow its subdomains. Redirect targets are followed after only the
  initial URL is checked, so the checked-in WAF rule must also constrain the
  canonical initial source shape.

- Purging the original source URL purges all varied-image content for that URL.

## Live-account inventory and applied state

### P0 — completed 2026-08-23

- Cloudflare account `84b32318ac235bf6738bdf1c8caa0795`; `festapp.net` zone
  `02fd6ca8f4652d62e9b05f24a5e9d84f` on the Free zone plan.
- Pre-cutover Worker rollback version:
  `c16a8e31-2e40-4d62-bb7c-d9432ed9b8ca` (version 42). It had public
  `festapp-images`, `festapp-images-a`, empty `festapp-images-temp`, an Images
  binding, two public custom domains, and an enabled `workers.dev` route.
- Aggregate R2 inventory (no object names recorded):

  | bucket | all objects / bytes | `images/` | `private/` | other |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | `festapp-images` | 277 / 92,079,150 | 270 / 91,387,601 | 0 / 0 | 7 / 691,549 |
  | `festapp-images-a` | 664 / 187,091,477 | 659 / 186,538,587 | 0 / 0 | 5 / 552,890 |
  | `festapp-images-temp` | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |

  All three had no custom R2 domains, disabled `r2.dev`, no CORS configuration,
  and only the default seven-day incomplete-multipart abort lifecycle rule.
- The databases identify `kjdpmixlnhntmxjedpxh` as the default project behind
  `img.festapp.net` and `lwfpdjxsdmkfyrzqbrlk` as project `a` behind
  `a.img.festapp.net`. Database aggregates contain 7 and 13 historical
  `private/` links respectively, but the corresponding public R2 prefix count is
  zero; no private objects were available to copy or delete.
- Image transformations were already enabled under the existing account PAYGO
  Images subscription. Dashboard usage was 174 unique transformations; the
  Free counter reported 0/5000. No plan or paid entitlement was activated or
  changed by this cutover. The 929 live `images/` objects imply a bounded
  three-preset upper bound of 2,787 unique source/preset pairs, below 5,000.
- Pre-state source policy was the entire `festapp.net` zone. No custom WAF
  entrypoint existed. Cache ruleset `e81c38494d8c4db3a89b2a9479f464b5`
  version 1 contained one unrelated CSM runtime-assets rule and was not changed.

### P1 — applied and validated

- Created empty private buckets `festapp-images-private` and
  `festapp-images-a-private`; both validated at 0 objects / 0 bytes. No source
  object copy or deletion was performed because both `private/` inventories were
  zero.
- Applied migration `20260823190000_authorize_image_deletion` to both Festapp
  Supabase projects. Both definitions have MD5
  `6506a2c6f76ba69a5f42017481368e60`, `SECURITY DEFINER`, fixed
  `search_path = public, extensions`, authenticated execute and no anon execute.
  The project-A pgTAP file passed and rolled back its test data. The default
  project could not run that unchanged pgTAP file because its older database
  lacks `create_user_for_test(text,text)`; definition/privilege validation there
  passed.
- Created a least-privilege Cache Purge token limited to the `festapp.net` zone
  and stored it only as Worker secret `CF_CACHE_PURGE_TOKEN`. Added the
  project-A anon secret from Supabase without recording either value. The live
  manifest now contains the eight expected secret names. An interim token whose
  value appeared in automation output was revoked immediately; a final
  inventory confirmed exactly one active token with this name and no token
  value in the repository.
- Deployed Worker version `4369e694-9b6b-4705-a67a-7397770ff21a` with the two
  private bindings, fail-closed project registry, exact CORS origins
  `https://csmostrava.festapp.net` and `https://vstupenky.online`, disabled
  private fallback, disabled `workers.dev`, and transitional custom domains
  `img.festapp.net`, `a.img.festapp.net`, `image-api.festapp.net`.
- Live smoke: both original public hosts returned 200; unknown control route 404
  JSON; unauthenticated upload 401 JSON; allowlisted CORS 204 with exact origin
  and `Vary: Origin`; denied CORS 403; cross-project host 400; `workers.dev` 404.
  Source bucket object counts remained 277 and 664.

### P2 — infrastructure applied; client gate remains open

- Source allowlist is now exactly
  `img.festapp.net/images/,a.img.festapp.net/images/` (modified
  `2026-08-23T19:32:04Z`).
- Created custom WAF ruleset `b9abeff61b454e0a870da4bbe5b1153b`, version 2,
  rule `b7bdd5d823704830b3da13f8eaa1eda7`. The checked-in renderer uses the raw URI
  path so nested source URLs, percent encoding and dot segments are evaluated
  before normalization.
- Live probes: canonical width-300 variants on both hosts returned 200 images;
  invalid width, reordered options, foreign source, cross-project source, outer
  query, encoded source and dot segment all returned 403. Dashboard usage still
  displayed 174 after the probes.
- No client build or release was produced. The checkout is detached at
  `84c1d5de5277d4388c25d07235700a93668345c4`, behind
  `origin/prod/csmostrava2026` at `dbd06e0fffb7e905885de7724873ab632cbb310c`,
  and contains unrelated dirty user work. Android signing configuration and a
  Google Play credential are absent. Under the release contract this is a hard
  stop before build or Play mutation.
- Recheck on 2026-08-24 found the clean local unified cutover source at
  `92fbd6e3b15040ca25dd9c7e43abc089616d2693` (`0.19.89+439`), while
  `origin/prod/csmostrava2026` still remained at
  `dbd06e0fffb7e905885de7724873ab632cbb310c`. The clean `+439` source does not
  contain `IMAGE_API_URL`/`IMAGE_PROJECT_ID` or the new image control client;
  the image cutover changes exist only in the mixed dirty checkout and therefore
  are not eligible release input.
- The 2026-08-24 local cutover validation passed: Worker TypeScript typecheck and
  full unit/integration suite (15 passed, 30 explicitly skipped), config
  propagation fixture, targeted Flutter image/control tests plus the affected
  speaker command tests (10 passed), and the web client test suite including the
  bounded image helper contract (160 passed).
- A clean release candidate was then assembled on 2026-08-24 in branch
  `release/image-delivery-cutover` on top of unified source
  `92fbd6e3b15040ca25dd9c7e43abc089616d2693`, with canonical version
  `0.19.90+440`. Only the image cutover, its direct call sites, generated version
  outputs and the pre-existing broken config fixture asset references were
  included; unrelated dirty speaker, occasion-save, ticket and sync changes were
  excluded. In this clean candidate the Worker typecheck/full suite passed, as
  did config propagation, targeted Flutter image/control tests and the web suite.
  Per operator instruction no Android bundle was built on the Mac; signed AAB
  production is owned exclusively by the Windows release workstation after the
  candidate becomes the clean remote canonical source.
- The Windows control channel was healthy and paired. Its last completed Play
  readback confirmed production version `438` at full distribution from source
  `dbd06e0fffb7e905885de7724873ab632cbb310c`; that version predates the image
  control-origin migration and cannot satisfy the adoption gate.
- Consequently the zero-legacy observation window/minimum-version gate has not
  begun. P3 public R2 domain cutover and P4 compatibility contraction were not
  performed.

## Authorized production checkpoints

### P0 — feasibility

- Target: approved isolated staging resources only.
- Pre-state to record: account/zone, Worker version/routes, R2 aggregate inventories,
  Images entitlement/usage, WAF/ruleset/cache versions and client endpoint metrics.
- Rollback identifier: staging resource IDs and pre-test ruleset versions.
- Expected cost: $0 on Images Free up to 5,000 unique monthly transformations;
  Paid activation is forbidden without separate monetary approval.
- Validation query/probes: bucket prefix aggregates; valid transform plus invalid
  width/order/query/encoding/dot-segment/foreign-source probes; source purge;
  HEAD/Range/ETag/cache behavior; post-probe transformation-usage delta.

### P1 — private/control preparation

- Target: `festapp-images-private`, `festapp-images-a-private`, and
  `image-api.festapp.net` -> `festapp-image-worker`.
- Pre-state: exact deployed Worker version/routes/bindings/secrets manifest and
  source `private/` count+bytes for both public buckets.
- Rollback: recorded Worker version and route/ruleset version; copied sources are
  retained until separately confirmed deletion.
- Expected cost: normal R2 Class A copy/write and control Worker requests; no
  paid Images activation.
- Validation: migration ledger parity, destination HEAD size/ETag evidence,
  default/A cross-project denial and new-write isolation. Source deletion remains
  a distinct authorized command.

### P2 — client adoption and bounded transforms

- Target: exact `img.festapp.net`/`a.img.festapp.net` source allowlist, generated
  fail-closed WAF rule, zone transformations and client release.
- Pre-state: ruleset version, Images entitlement/usage, active source count and
  current endpoint traffic by installed version.
- Rollback: prior ruleset version; disable transformations and release/control
  clients continue to use originals.
- Expected cost: Free behavior above, or `(unique-5000)/1000 × $0.50` only after
  explicit Paid approval.
- Validation: all negative probes rejected before Images; helper/rule contract
  parity; zero legacy control traffic for the agreed window or minimum-version gate.

### P3 — public R2 cutover

- Target: `img.festapp.net` -> `festapp-images` and `a.img.festapp.net` ->
  `festapp-images-a`, plus scoped CORS/cache/header/Smart Tiered Cache rules.
- Pre-state: zero `private/` and zero nonpublic-prefix objects in each target,
  exact Worker route/version and DNS/custom-domain/cache-rule versions.
- Rollback: recorded Worker version/routes only; private storage and server-owned
  auth are not rolled back.
- Expected cost: no public-view Worker requests; R2 Class B only on cache misses;
  Images cost remains the accepted P2 entitlement.
- Validation: original/legacy-query/variant MISS->HIT probes on both hosts,
  Range/HEAD/ETag/content type, delete+purge 404, and zero Worker invocation delta.

### P4 — contraction

- Target: remove old public Worker routes, legacy URL alias, fallback reader,
  unused Images binding (if upload compression no longer needs it), and stale secrets.
- Pre-state: accepted P3 metrics and zero legacy control traffic.
- Rollback: release policy/minimum version, not restoration of mixed auth routing.
- Expected cost: no new product cost.
- Validation: topology guard and absence searches, then 7-day/full-cycle Worker,
  R2 Class B and unique-transformation metrics against the recorded baseline.
