# Legacy Festapp client inventory — 2026-08-30

The repository and hosting inventory found four production refs without the
canonical `automation/project.conf` contract. They must not be rebuilt as a
batch. Each receives one explicit release, replacement or retirement decision.
Private inventory evidence is stored outside the repository at
`~/.local/share/festapp-rehearsal-20260830/legacy-tenant-config-inventory.json`.
A second scan covered all 33 remote refs, including feature, rehearsal and
cutover refs, rather than only `prod/*`. Its private result is
`~/.local/share/festapp-rehearsal-20260830/all-remote-client-config-inventory.json`
(SHA-256 `2f8348663c6bf1bd510bfdf7143ee96a6c31ae73d22de3855e311a4639dc2549`).
Eighteen refs contain a client configuration, but they collapse to the already
registered production identities plus CSM rehearsal/feature snapshots. No
additional historical application was found outside the 14 production refs.

## `prod/aksmcz` / Celostátní setkání animátorů (CSA 2024)

The branch is a real historical tenant, not an unused test. It is pinned to
source `a`, organization `1`, occasion `csa2024`, and app name `CSA 2024`.
That occasion ran from 12–17 August 2024 and contains 391 events and 340
occasion-user relations. The canonical merge preserved it as organization `4`
and occasion `1072505`.

`aksmcz.netlify.app` still serves the old application, while its recorded
custom origin `app.rawen.dev` no longer resolves. Before source `a` is retired,
the lane needs an explicit archive/retirement decision and store-listing
readback. No new tenant name, custom domain or mobile release is inferred from
the historical acronym.

Public App Store readback found the still-listed `CSA 2024`, Apple ID
`6479449613`, bundle `festapp.aksmcz`, version `0.13.0`, last released on
12 May 2025. The public Google Play URL for package `fstapp.csa` returns 404.
The Apple listing therefore remains a real external consumer and cannot be
silently retired or reassigned without an explicit listing decision.

This is the older “Setkání animátorů” application referred to in operational
discussions; it is not an additional fifteenth production ref. The repository
acronym `aksmcz` and the public listing name `CSA 2024` identify the same lane.

## `prod/farnostopava` / Rezervace Farnost Opava

Farnost Opava is now proven web-only. Release `0.19.93+474` is based on main
`67b49c3e4916009841c50006c8f3e4251313d23d` and production overlay
`ea5e608410a84d24bb4bf7120347b24304243e05`. It retains source-`a`
organization `8`, pins canonical organization `11`, preserves the source-`a`
Auth storage namespace, and has no OneSignal configuration or mobile release.

Cloudflare Pages deployment `bf422d3c.farnostopava.pages.dev` passes the
coherent release verifier. The public `rezervace.farnostopava.cz` surface is
temporarily serving the identical static adapter from Netlify deployment
`6a937f193b8c71ae6664bf26`; root, form and admin routes return 200, the visible
tenant heading is correct, and browser QA observed zero OneSignal resources.
Cloudflare has accepted the custom-domain binding, but DNS remains externally
blocked: the WEDOS-hosted `farnostopava.cz` zone is not present in the available
WEDOS account. Its owner must change only CNAME `rezervace` from
`farnostopava.netlify.app` to `farnostopava.pages.dev`. After Cloudflare reports
the domain active, the Netlify origin can be reduced to the registered
path/query-preserving retirement surface without another application build.

## `prod/avapp`

This is the pre-canonical Absolventský Velehrad client, version `0.7.4+45`.
Its old Supabase hostname `jyghacisbuntbrshhhey.supabase.co` no longer resolves,
and the modern tenant is already owned by `prod/absolventskyvelehrad` at
`app.absolventskyvelehrad.cz`. The old Android identity `vkhcr.avapp` therefore
needs store retirement/readback rather than a second AV web deployment. Its
historical iOS identity collides with the current Festapp lane and must not be
uploaded independently.

## `prod/slunovratopava`

This is an obsolete duplicate of `prod/festivalslunovrat`, last updated in
2024. The canonical Slunovrat source, web origin and mobile identities are now
owned by `prod/festivalslunovrat`; the old branch must not generate a second
release. Remaining work is limited to legacy-origin and store-listing
retirement evidence.

## `prod/ticketonline` / `vstupenka.online`

The singular-domain client and canonical `vstupenky.online` both use the
default Supabase project, organization `3`, no forced occasion and no Flutter
application surface. The singular site has no activation document and serves
an obsolete full Flutter bundle. It is therefore a compatibility alias, not a
separate tenant.

The canonical-cutover contract is HTTP 301 from `vstupenka.online` to the same
path and query on `vstupenky.online`, while historical Flutter, Festapp and push
worker URLs return only an unregister/cache-retirement worker. The registered
deployment is generated by `automation/build_netlify_retirement.mjs` and
applied through the acknowledged `automation/deploy_netlify_retirement.sh`;
the retired origin contains no application or Edge Function implementation.
Production Netlify deploy `6a9375a25c482a6d9d81f2c0` passed that contract,
and `prod/ticketonline` commit `f4ab1601e2f5bb8d93a0249e2f6f4cdc5c8c558b`
now prevents future automatic builds from restoring the obsolete Flutter app.

## Inventory result

Fourteen production refs were inspected: ten have canonical configurations and
four originally lacked them. Farnost Opava has since been closed as a web-only
lane, while the four legacy dispositions listed in the release matrix remain
tracked explicitly. The remaining broad source-`a` entries are not
unknown tenants; they are all-unit catalogue clients whose write reachability
still closes under the shared freeze/write-authority gate. No Android or iOS
build is authorized by this inventory.
