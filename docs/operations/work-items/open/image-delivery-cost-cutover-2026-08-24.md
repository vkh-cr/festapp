This work item tracks live operational state only. The linked plan remains
authoritative for architecture, security, migration and validation.

## Outcome

- `img.festapp.net` and `a.img.festapp.net` serve public images directly from
  their project-specific R2 buckets through Cloudflare CDN without public-view
  Worker invocations.
- `image-api.festapp.net` is the only authenticated plane for upload, delete,
  private reads and signing.
- Android, iOS and web production clients use the dedicated control origin and
  stable `projectId`.
- Every temporary legacy control route, alias, fallback, binding and secret is
  removed after installed-client adoption.

## Fixed point

- Canonical branch: `prod/csmostrava2026`.
- Release source SHA: `cbb3fa7425b7c33b2cab1bba4e2ffe8765f5b6cc`.
- Current branch/registry SHA: `4429055d1f11ae3f1abac05b7c71b631fd5946e1`.
- Target client version: `0.19.90+440`.
- Google Play production version: `438` at full distribution.
- Submitted iOS build: `439`; it predates the image cutover.
- Worker version: `4369e694-9b6b-4705-a67a-7397770ff21a`.
- WAF ruleset/rule: `b9abeff61b454e0a870da4bbe5b1153b` version 2 /
  `b7bdd5d823704830b3da13f8eaa1eda7`.

## Completed actions

- P0 inventory, pricing/entitlement and topology checks completed.
- Private R2 buckets created; aggregate inventory proved no private source
  objects required copying or deletion.
- `authorize_image_deletion` migration applied and verified in both Supabase
  projects.
- Dedicated control Worker, private bindings, project registry, CORS and purge
  secret deployed and smoke-tested.
- Exact Images source allowlist and bounded fail-closed transformation WAF rule
  applied and positively/negatively probed.
- Clean source `0.19.90+440` validated, committed and pushed to the canonical
  production branch. No Android build ran on the Mac.
- Production Windows command `1027` enqueued against the exact current branch
  SHA for read-only Play inspection and a new signed AAB build; it supersedes
  commands `1025` and `1026`, and Play mutation is explicitly forbidden.

## Next action

Power on or wake the production Windows workstation and let its existing
user-scoped Festapp Control Channel monitor process command `1027`. Accept only a
matching `COMPLETE` or exact `BLOCKED` result. Do not enqueue a duplicate build.

Expected result: a newly built signed `fstapp.jm2025` AAB with version code `440`,
checkout SHA `4429055d1f11ae3f1abac05b7c71b631fd5946e1` containing release source
`cbb3fa7425b7c33b2cab1bba4e2ffe8765f5b6cc`, matching upload certificate,
AAB SHA-256, non-secret provenance manifest and explicit proof that no Play edit
was created.

## Remaining order

1. Produce and independently inspect the Android AAB on Windows.
2. Produce the iOS `0.19.90+440` archive from the same canonical source through
   the established Apple release workflow; do not substitute build `439`.
3. Present and obtain exact artifact-specific production authorizations for
   Google Play and App Store, release both clients, and read back store state.
4. Deploy and verify the web client carrying the canonical image contract.
5. Prove zero legacy control traffic for the authoritative window or enforce an
   approved minimum Android/iOS version.
6. Execute P3: reconfirm public-bucket safety, attach both public hostnames
   directly to R2, apply cache/header/CORS/Smart Tiered Cache configuration and
   prove zero public Worker invocation delta.
7. Execute P4: remove public Worker routing, `legacySupabaseUrl`, private
   fallback, migration-only code and unused bindings/secrets/tests/docs.
8. Record a seven-day/full-cycle cost and health observation, update evidence,
   and close this work item.

## Current blocker

The Mac control-channel master is healthy (`health=200`, unauthorized queue
access returns `401`, pairing exists), but the Windows result cursor has not
advanced beyond command `1024`. Commands `1025`, `1026` and `1027` have no result. The
required external action is only to wake the Windows workstation and allow its
monitor to resume polling.

## Authority gates

| Action | Required authority | State |
|---|---|---|
| Google Play production release | Exact package, version code, source SHA, AAB SHA-256, production track and rollout action | waiting for AAB |
| App Store submission/release | Exact bundle/build identity, source SHA, archive identity and release action | waiting for archive |
| P3 R2 custom-domain mutation | Recorded pre-state, rollback IDs, zero-private inventory and completed adoption gate | pending |
| P4 destructive contraction | Verified P3 state and zero legacy control traffic | pending |

## Rollback and recovery

- Android/iOS artifacts authorize no store mutation; discard and rebuild from a
  higher valid version if identity or provenance fails.
- Store rollout rollback uses halt/superseding release semantics; version codes
  are never reused.
- P3 records Worker route/version, DNS/custom-domain and cache ruleset versions
  immediately before mutation. Private storage and server-owned authorization
  are not rolled back to the mixed legacy architecture.

## Definition of complete

- [ ] Android `0.19.90+440` is released and its exact artifact is verified.
- [ ] iOS `0.19.90+440` is released and its exact artifact is verified.
- [ ] The web client with the canonical image contract is deployed and verified.
- [ ] The adoption/minimum-version gate excludes every legacy control client.
- [ ] Both public image hosts serve directly from their project-specific R2
  buckets with zero public-view Worker invocations.
- [ ] P4 removes every temporary alias, route, fallback, binding and secret.
- [ ] Final cost/health metrics and resource versions are recorded in evidence.
- [ ] This file is moved to `../completed/` and removed from the open index.
