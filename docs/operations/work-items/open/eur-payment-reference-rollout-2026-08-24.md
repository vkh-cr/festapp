# Work item: roll out canonical EUR payment references

Opened: 2026-08-24
Updated: 2026-08-24
Status: blocked
Verification: release

## Authoritative sources

- Plan: [`../../../plans/2026-08-05_eur_payment_reference_plan.md`](../../../plans/2026-08-05_eur_payment_reference_plan.md)
- Execution prompt: [`../../../plans/2026-08-05_eur_payment_reference_execution_prompt.md`](../../../plans/2026-08-05_eur_payment_reference_execution_prompt.md)

## Outcome

EUR orders use one creditor-reference contract end to end, production payment
pairing is verified, and obsolete pairing paths are absent.

## Fixed point

- Implementation branch: `origin/feature/eur-payment-cutover`.
- Source SHA: `a903ea681`.
- Production migrations: not applied.

## Completed actions

- Implementation and targeted local verification are complete.
- The exact source commit is preserved on the remote feature branch.

## Next action

Authorize and run the plan's read-only production preflight against the project
resolved from `automation/project.conf`; stop on any tenant mismatch.

## Remaining order

1. Record production pre-state and rollback identifiers.
2. Obtain explicit authorization and apply the two ordered migrations.
3. Deploy compatible Edge/client surfaces in the plan's order.
4. Run the pilot, pairing reconciliation and observation gates.
5. Remove obsolete compatibility paths and integrate through canonical main/tenant generation.

## Current blocker

Production database inspection/migration and rollout require a separate release authorization.

## Authority gates

| Action | Required authority | State |
|---|---|---|
| Production preflight | Explicit live-project inspection authorization | pending |
| Apply migrations | Exact project ref, migration IDs, pre-state and rollback confirmation | pending |
| Client/backend rollout | Exact source/artifact/deployment identities | pending |

## Rollback and recovery

- Keep the current production schema and client path until preflight passes.
- Forward-fix with a higher migration/version after activation; never partially reorder the two migrations.

## Definition of complete

- [ ] Ordered migrations and all runtime consumers use the canonical reference contract.
- [ ] Production pilot and reconciliation are verified.
- [ ] Obsolete pairing paths are removed.
- [ ] Observation evidence is recorded.
- [ ] This item is moved to `../completed/` and the index is updated.

## Operational log

| Date | Action | Receipt/evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-24 | Preserve implementation | `origin/feature/eur-payment-cutover` at `a903ea681` | no local-only implementation remains |
