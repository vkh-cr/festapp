# Canonical main and production tenant overlays

`main` owns all shared Flutter, web, SQL, Edge Function, worker, test,
configuration-generator and release-tooling code. Production branches are
forward-only deployment overlays over one recorded main SHA; shared features
must never be implemented by deleting source files or checking a Git branch at
runtime.

Each production branch owns `automation/project.conf`, explicitly listed brand
assets and namespaced legal/store/offline-map/recovery data. It also records:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "tenantId": "csmostrava2026",
  "baseMainSha": "<40-character-main-sha>"
}
```

The allowlists, generated-path list, metadata schema and drift checker are
loaded with `git show` from `baseMainSha`. A production branch cannot expand its
own policy. The checker creates a fresh archive of main, overlays only approved
source/data paths, runs `automation/apply_config.sh` once and compares generated
leaves byte-for-byte with the branch:

```bash
git show "$BASE_MAIN_SHA:automation/check_tenant_branch_drift.sh" >/tmp/check-tenant-drift.sh
chmod +x /tmp/check-tenant-drift.sh
CANONICAL_MAIN_REF=origin/main /tmp/check-tenant-drift.sh \
  "$BASE_MAIN_SHA" "$TENANT_ID" HEAD
```

Never generate tenant B over tenant A's mutated tree. Start from a clean main
tree for every profile. `automation/tests/tenant_config_matrix.test.sh` proves
idempotence and cross-tenant isolation with synthetic public identities.

## Required legal and support contract

Every tenant `automation/project.conf` must define `PRIVACY_URL`,
`PRIVACY_CHOICES_URL`, `TERMS_URL`, `SUPPORT_URL`, and `DELETE_ACCOUNT_URL` on
the configured HTTPS deploy origin at their canonical paths. Tenant-owned
Markdown in `automation/release/legal/` is the source for the four public legal
and support documents; their `web/` HTML files are generated leaves and must
never be edited independently.

`automation/apply_config.sh` fails before generation when a required value or
source is missing. `automation/verify_web_build.mjs` rejects missing, duplicate,
foreign-branded, or SPA-fallback output, and
`automation/verify_web_deployment.mjs` repeats those checks against the live
deployment. An HTTP 200 alone is not proof that a legal route exists.

## Normal tenant upgrade

1. Develop and validate shared behavior in main.
2. Merge the exact verified main commit forward into the production branch.
3. Reapply only tenant source/data overlay paths from the pre-cutover tip.
4. Run `automation/apply_config.sh automation/project.conf` from the fresh main
   template and update `automation/tenant-overlay.json`.
5. Run the main-owned drift checker and targeted tenant build tests.
6. Commit/push/deploy only through the separately approved release workflow.

Conflicts in shared source always resolve to main's canonical content. A
conflict in an allowed overlay path is an explicit tenant decision; blanket
`ours` resolutions are forbidden.

## Private input boundary

Festapp owns public schemas and authorization/business logic.
`automation/private-inputs.schema.json` and
`automation/tenant-external-services.schema.json` declare input names and
types without values. FestappSeed or an approved secret manager owns private
credentials, provisioning material and production seed payloads. Missing
required input fails closed; the repository never searches an implicit sibling
directory or prints a supplied value.

The `AGREEMENT_PDF` external-service contract is the canonical source for
tenant organizer, clause, logo and font values used by
`generate-order-agreement`. The old tenant-named endpoint has no runtime caller
in main and is removed from the source tree. Deploying the canonical endpoint
and provisioning its tenant data are separate operational steps.
