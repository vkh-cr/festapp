# Feedback Component

Provides a mechanism for users to submit feedback directly from the application.

## Usage

The main entry point is `feedack_floating_button.dart` (note: legacy typo in
filename), which renders a floating action button or overlay allowing users to
send text feedback or report issues.

## Localization

Strings are managed in `feedback_strings.dart`.
