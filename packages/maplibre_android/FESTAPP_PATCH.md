# Festapp patch for `maplibre_android` 0.3.5

This repository pin preserves high-resolution Flutter style images without
letting `BitmapFactory` interpolate them a second time. The shared platform
interface supplies the image pixel ratio explicitly; Android assigns that
density to the decoded bitmap while keeping its original pixel dimensions.

The Android map state also maps `MapLibreMap.active` to the native
`onStart/onResume` and `onPause/onStop` lifecycle. This keeps cached map
resources in memory without rendering an offstage tab continuously.

Remove this package and the root `dependency_overrides` entry once upstream
supports an explicit pixel ratio for style images and pausing a retained map.
Validate removal by checking downloaded custom pins and background CPU after
switching away from the map on Android.
